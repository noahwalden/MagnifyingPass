# MagnifyingPass

A password manager whose primary objective is to provide you with the
credentials you're looking for ASAP.

This application is heavily based on other excellent password managers
I've used in the past, including 1Password and especially
[Passbolt](https://www.passbolt.com/), which I recently set up to manage
passwords for a club on campus.
